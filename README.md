### Need a converter and some clever code to help out and remove as much interaction as possible.

Basic concept is to avoid copying my books onto my tablet via USB, so I can read them while I'm at home.
So I'll want to expose the endpoint securely on my desktop or the cloud, so I can find a book. Download it in full for offline reading or page through it while online. 
Expected formats will be native (what ever format I got the book in) and Html for doing paging
